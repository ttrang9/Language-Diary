Interim Report 1 - 12/03/2024

Add stuffs - 

Interim report 2 - 4/4/2024
I changed a lot of the UI for EntryInput + did some input managing.
Now I can view the list of entries in chronological time.

I'm still struggling with the UI for monthly view calendar. I literally just thought
of another approach yesterday but haven't tried implemented that yet.

Interim report 3 - 23/4/2024
I have (hopefully) successfully implemented the reading/writing part of the application (Save+Delete).
Still, I don't know if it's my computer, or sth else, but around 70% of the time
I exist the app, I have to choose "reload from disk" for the json file to update. I have no idea why.

Things left to do:
- Easy requirements: Edit entry, Filter/search entry in the table according to some conditions,
 show events in calendar and in an interval, tests/errors handling (?)
- Medium: Numerical Data
